  # TJD or tjd is the Truncated Julian Day convention
  #   for numbering days sequentially.
  #    (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day ) 
  #   TJD was introduced by NASA in 1979. Its epoch 
  #   is 0h May 24, 1968. TJD counts days sequentially 
  #   since that epoch. The longer Julian date requires
  #   many extra under-utilized bits; it is the days since 
  #   12h Jan 1, 4713 BC.  Their relationship: 
  #      TJD == JD âˆ’ 2440000.5, or
  #      JD  == TJD + 2440000.5; the 0.5 occurs since
  #      the JD counts from noon instead of midnight.
  #
  # TJD makes for convenient comparison and compuation,
  #  and in addition we adapt it to the local timezone,
  #  instead of UTC Greenwich time.
